Characteristics:
- DIP-40 socket - allows to use with following microcontrollers:
  - ATmega8515
  - ATmega8535
  - ATmega16
  - ATmega162
  - ATmega32
  - ATmega644
  - ATmega128

 - Build-in USB-UART controller
 - DC/DC module can be replaced with battery pack; offering self-latching controlled from ATmega
 - 20-pin expansion port with main signals in one place (VDD, VCC, GND, 3.3V, I2C, UART...) - you may create your own modules
 - flexible clock options - crystal / RC oscylator / external signal (generated from FT232R)
 - Digital input modules (buttons, encoder, IR receiver, digital 1-wire termometer)
 - Bigital output modules (LEDs, LCD display, OLED display, 4-dig 7segment display, buzzer)
 - Analog input (voltage divider)
 - Analog output (aplified speaker)
 - Additional modules:
   - RTC with flexibility to use different modules
   - EEPROM
   - Power driver
   - Optoisolators
   - RS485 Transceiver
   - Motor driver
   - UART communication port to use WiFi / LAN or BT modules
